# Data--Visualization
Created a final dataframe by merging mouse_metadata and study_results.
Generated a new dataframe with unique mouse IDs.
Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, SEM) of tumor volume for each drug regimen.
Visualized data using bar graphs and pie charts with pandas and pyplot.
Analyzed quartiles and outliers for four promising treatments: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
Created boxplots showing the distribution of final tumor volume for mice in each treatment group.
For Capomulin-treated mice:
- Generated a line plot of tumor volume vs. timepoint
- Created a scatter plot
- Calculated correlation and performed regression analysis
